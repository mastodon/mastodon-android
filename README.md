## Contributing

Our goal is delivering a polished, professionally designed and user-friendly app. We proceed according to wireframes provided by a professional UX designer that works with Mastodon gGmbH. This means that any outside contributions that change the app visually must first be coordinated with the UX designer. *This can take time.* Furthermore, we work off of an internal roadmap and aim for feature-parity and consistency with our iOS app. The iOS app is designated as the "primary" between the two, therefore, if you want to request features, please do so in the [Mastodon for iOS](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon-ios) repository, as you are requesting a feature to be both in iOS and Android (exceptions being system integrations specific to Android). This is not meant to say that the iOS version is more important than the Android version. On the other hand, any contributions that improve existing functionality, performance, or accessibility should not have any roadblocks to being merged.

If you would like to help translate the app into your language, please go to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/mastodon-for-android). If your language is not listed in the Crowdin project, please create an issue and we will add it. Please do not create pull requests that modify `strings.xml` files for languages other than English.

## Building

```
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
