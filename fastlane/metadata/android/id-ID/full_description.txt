Mastodon adalah jejaring sosial terdesentralisasi terbesar di internet. Instead of a single website, it’s a network of millions of users in independent communities that can all interact with one another, seamlessly. No matter what you’re into, you can meet passionate people posting about it on Mastodon!

Join a community and create your profile. Find and and follow fascinating folks and read their posts in an ad-free, chronological timeline. Express yourself with custom emoji, images, GIFs, videos, and audio in 500-character posts. Reply to threads and reblog posts from anyone to share great stuff. Temukan akun-akun baru untuk diikuti dan hashtag yang sedang tren untuk memperluas jejaring Anda.

Mastodon dibuat dengan fokus pada privasi dan keamanan. Tentukan apakah postingan Anda dibagikan kepada pengikut, hanya orang yang disebut, atau seluruh dunia. Content warnings let you hide posts containing sensitive or triggering material until you're ready to engage with them. Each community has its own guidelines and moderators to keep its members safe, and robust blocking and reporting tools help prevent abuse.

Mastodon is a registered nonprofit and development is supported directly by your donations. There’s no advertising, no monetization, and no venture capital, and we plan to keep it that way.
